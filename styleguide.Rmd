```

## Style choices

- R is written as `R`
- R package names are written as `*pkgname*`
  and will appear
  in italics (e.g. *pkgname*), except in section headings,
  where they are written in plain text, e.g. `pkgname`
- First package citations use the standard citation, followed by a "website" link, e.g. `tables (@R-tables, [website](...))`
- Function names are written as ``` `fname()` ```
- Function arguments are written as ``` `argument` ```
- git is written ``` `git` ``` as are other software packages
  e.g. ```the LaTeX package `longtables` ```
- Github is written capitalized in plain text: `Github`
