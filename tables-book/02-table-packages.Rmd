# Overview table R packages {#tablepkgs}

We summarizes various `R` packages to create production ready tables in clincial research. 
The list is by no means complete, if you know another package that has been useful for you to
create tables or listing using clinical trials data. 
Please contribute to this chapter.

## gt

The `gt` package has a high-level and declarative interface for composing
tables. Contains a variety of `formatter` functions for transforming cell values
from an input data frame to the desired reporting values (combines mutation and
aesthetic styling with options for: scientific notation, uncertainty, ranges,
percentages, suffixes, localized currency, etc.). Multiple output formats are
supported with the same declarative interface (e.g., HTML, LaTeX/PDF, and RTF).

## rtables

The `rtables` package defines a pipe-able grammar for declaring complex table
structure layouts via nested splitting - in row- and column-space - and the
specification of analysis functions which will calculate cell values within that
structure. These pre-data table layouts are then applied to data to build the
table, during which all necessary data grouping implied by the row and column
splits, cell value calculation, and tabulation occurs automatically. Additional
table features such as titles, footers, and referential footnotes are supported.
ASCII, HTML, and PDF are supported as output formats for rendering tables.

`rtables` source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/roche/rtables) as well
as the [documentation](https://roche.github.io/rtables/). `rtables` is also available
on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtables).

## flextable

`flextable` is providing a *grammar* for creating and customizing tables. The
following formats are supported: 'Word' (*.docx), 'PowerPoint' (*.pptx), 'PDF'
and 'HTML'. The syntax is the same for the user regardless of the type of output
to be produced. A set of functions allows the creation, definition of cell
arrangement, addition of headers, formatting and definition of cell content
(i.e. text and or images). The package also offers a set of high-level functions
that allow, for example, tabular reporting of statistical models and the
creation of complex cross tabulations.
