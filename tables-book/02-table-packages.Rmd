# Overview of table R packages {#tablepkgs}

There are many R packages available that can help with the creation of
production-ready tables for clinical research. We provide here a listing
of the most notable packages available for this purpose. The descriptions
are meant to provide a basic overview of what each package is capable of,
and, the general focus area for each. Word of warning: the list is by no
means complete. There are possibly dozens of such packages, but we were
selective in choosing which of those to present here (mostly in the
interest of not presenting too much material, so as to not burden the
reader with too many alternatives).

## gt

The *gt* package [@R-gt, [website](https://gt.rstudio.com/)] provides
a high-level and declarative interface for composing tables. The package
contains a large variety of formatting functions for transforming cell values
from an input data frame to the desired reporting values. There are options for
scientific notation, percentages, localized currencies, expressing uncertainties
and ranges, dates and times, etc.). The package has the ability to generate summary
rows, footnotes, source notes, and structure the table with a stub and column
spanners. Multiple output formats are supported with the same declarative interface
(e.g., HTML, LaTeX/PDF, RTF, and Word).

The *gt* source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/gt) and the
[project website](https://gt.rstudio.com) provides a wealth of documentation. The
package is also available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gt).

## r2rtf

The *r2rtf* package [@r2rtf2020, [website](https://merck.github.io/r2rtf/)]
allows for the creation of production-ready tables and figures in the RTF format. 
This R package provides simple, composable functions (with the “verb” semantics
pattern) that correspond to each component of a table. Incoming data is treated as
immutable so the only focus for the final formatting of the table. The package is
well-suited for regulatory filings given that it has extensive support for table
pagination and a means for compiling several tables into a single RTF file. Chapters
1-9 of [The R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission](https://r4csr.org/) book 
provides examples that use *r2rtf*.

The source code is on [GitHub]([https://github.com/rstudio/gt](https://github.com/Merck/r2rtf)
and the [project website]([https://gt.rstudio.com](https://merck.github.io/r2rtf/)
provides a function reference and many helpful articles. The package is also
available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=r2rtf).

## rtables

The *rtables* package [@R-rtables, [website](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/main/)] defines a pipe-able grammar for declaring complex table
structure layouts via nested splitting -- in row- and column-space -- and the
specification of analysis functions which will calculate cell values within that
structure. These pre-data table layouts are then applied to data to build the
table, during which all necessary data grouping implied by the row and column
splits, cell value calculation, and tabulation occurs automatically. Additional
table features such as titles, footers, and referential footnotes are supported.
ASCII, HTML, and PDF are supported as output formats for rendering tables.

The *rtables* source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/roche/rtables) as well
as the [documentation](https://roche.github.io/rtables/). The package is also available
on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtables).

## flextable

*flextable* [@R-flextable, [website](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/)] 
provides a *grammar* for creating and customizing tables. The
following formats are supported: 'Word' (*.docx), 'PowerPoint' (*.pptx), 'RTF', 'PDF'
,'HTML' and R 'Grid Graphics'. The syntax is the same for the user regardless of
the type of output to be produced. A set of functions allows the creation,
definition of cell arrangement, addition of headers or footers, formatting and
definition of cell content (i.e. text and or images). The package also offers a
set of high-level functions that allow, for example, tabular reporting of
statistical models and the creation of complex cross tabulations.

Source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable) and a 
[user manual](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/) is available. 
The package is also available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flextable).

## tfrmt

The *tfrmt* (@R-tfrmt, [website](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/tfrmt/)) package 
provides a language for defining display-related metadata and table formatting 
before any data is available. This package offers an intuitive interface for 
defining and layering standard or custom formats, to which ARD (analysis 
results data) is supplied. It also presents the novel ability to easily 
generate mock displays using metadata that will be used for the actual 
displays. *tfrmt* is built on top of the *gt* package, which is intended to 
support a variety of output formats in the future. Table features (titles, 
header, footnotes, etc.) as well as specific formatting (e.g. rounding, 
scientific notation, alignment, spacing) are supported.

The *tfrmt* source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/GSK-Biostatistics/tfrmt) and
documentation can be found in the [project website](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/tfrmt/).
The package is also available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tfrmt).

## tables

The *tables* package [@R-tables, [website](https://dmurdoch.github.io/tables/)] provides a formula-driven interface for
computing the contents of tables and formatting them.  It was 
inspired by `SAS PROC TABULATE`, but is not compatible with it.

The user computes a table object by specifying a formula, with the
left-hand side giving the rows, and the right-hand side giving the columns;
the formula describes the summary functions to apply and how to organize them.
The objects can be subsetted or combined using matrix-like operations. Tables can
be rendered in plain text, LaTeX code to appear in a PDF document, or HTML
code for a web document.

The package is on CRAN. Source is maintained on R-forge at
https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/tables/ and mirrored on Github at
https://github.com/rforge/tables/. Vignettes in the package serve as a user manual;
browse them at https://rdrr.io/cran/tables/, or install the package, then run
`browseVignettes(package = "tables")`.

## tidytlg

The *tidytlg* package (@R-tidytlg, [website](https://github.com/pharmaverse/tidytlg)) provides a framework for creating tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) using 
Tidyverse (@tidyverse). It offers a suite of analysis functions to summarize descriptive statistics 
(univariate statistics and counts (percentages)) for table creation and a function 
to convert analysis results to rtf/html outputs. For graphic output, tidytlg can 
integrate plot objects created by ggplot2 or a png file with titles and footnotes 
to produce rtf/html output. 

*tidytlg* [source code](https://github.com/pharmaverse/tidytlg) and  [documentation](https://pharmaverse.github.io/tidytlg/main/)
are on Github.
