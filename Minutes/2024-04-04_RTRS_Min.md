Minutes by Joseph Rickert

### Attendees
* Gabe Becker
* David Gohel
* Alexandra Lauer
* Himanshu Panya - Arcus
* Joseph B Rickert - ProCogia
* Adrian Waddell = Genentech
* S. W. Wang

Those present agreed that there is still work to be done on: 

* Value Formatting
* Listings

There was no consensus, however, on whether the working group should take the next step beyond showing how to build tables and produce table shells. It was agreed than this task would require agreement on the details from a number of pharma companies and perhaps require FDA buy in.

Alex suggested writing a position paper on what would be required to do this work.

There was also some discussion as to whether activity initiated by the new European agreement might make Health Technology Assessment an area of interest for this working group.

Alex informed the group that she has change employment and will no longer be attending group meeting.

We all wish to than Alex for her many, varied contributions to the working group and the document. We will miss her analytical approach and wry wit in group discussions.

**Actions:**

* Adrian and David will fix the problem with the link for the dev version of the document
* Gabe will complete the section outlining value formatting.

The May meeting of the working group will be on Thursday May 2, 2024 at 9AM PST.
