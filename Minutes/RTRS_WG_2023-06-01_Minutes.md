The group discussed a schedule for the publication for version 1 of the ebook and the work required to make it happen.

### Work to be done before publication

* Package authors will review their sections and make any final updates
* Authors will strive to achieve consistency with respect to the use of quotation marks for package and function names

**Actions:**

* JBR will contact package authors for `tfmrt` (Atorus) and `GT` (Rich Iannone)
* Duncan will review the entire document for function and package name consistency
* David will make some final updates with respect to links to references and rendering the document

### Decisions

* The published version of the document will eventually live on an R Consortium web page
* The current working version of the document will be available from the GitHub repository
* Eventually we will work out a system to make all future published versions of the document available, not just the most recent version
* We will seek a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) identifier for the ebook
* The section on `r2rtf` will be removed from the first published version of the document because the table sections for this package have not been completed. It may be added back at a later time.
* The Lab Tables section of the document will be removed

**Actions:**

* JBR will begin the processes of obtaining a DOI and of arranging for an R Consortium URL for the document

### Schedule
* All updates for the first publication of the ebook must be made by close of business on Friday  June 9, 2023.
* The working group will meet at 9AM Pacific Time on Thursday June 15, 2023 to decide if the document is ready to be published.
* If all goes well, the document will be published on June 23, 2023.
* Gabe will mention June 23 as the expected publication date during his R / Medicine workshop and talk which will happen during the week of June 5.
