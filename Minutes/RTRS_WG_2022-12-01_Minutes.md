Those present reviewed the [document](https://rconsortium.github.io/rtrs-wg/) and discussed progress and formatting issues.

The group also discussed plans for next year which included seeking FDA involvement in the working group and promoting the document through blog posts and conference presentations.

The group would like to have the FDA critique the document and is interested in FDA ideas about checking consistency and correctness of tables and in conducting cross comparisions.

Possible conference opportunities include:

* [DISS2023](https://sites.duke.edu/diss/) - March 29-31
* [PHUSE US Connect](https://sites.duke.edu/diss/) - March 5 - 8
* R/Medicine - June 8 and 9 2023
* The ASA Biopharmaceutical Section [Regulatory Industry Statistics Workshop](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/biop/2022/workshopinfo.cfm) - Sept?
* posit::conf (info to be available in Decenber)
* R/Pharma - Nov?


In anticapitation of haveing more table package developers interested in having their packages included in the document, the group agreed that we should publish clear inclusion criteria on the GitHub site. We would like to include all packages that are capable of producing the majority of the tables included in the document and exclude packages that provide only one or two table types.

** Action Items**

* JBR to rescheduld January meeting to 2023-01-02 and invite Paul Schuette and other FDA members to attend.
* TT to ask colleague for an example of a realistic, generic Lab table and provide a PK table.
