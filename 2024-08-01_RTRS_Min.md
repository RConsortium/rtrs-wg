## RTRS Working Group Minutes: August 1, 2024


### Attendees
* Keaven Anderson - Merck
* Gabriel Becker
* Joseph Rickert - R Consortium
* Adrian Waddell - Genentech

The decision was made to freeze both the production and development versions of the e-book as they are. Adrian will complete a draft of a letter to the R Community that hes has begun explaining the situation. The letter will also point to future work that the group has identified, but lacks the expertise and manpower to complete and also include a list of people who have participated in the working group over time.

Prominent areas for future work that the working group has identified but will not be able to address are the automation of table generation and table workflows.

The list at the names at the bottom of this page is meant to be a complete list of people who have participated in the working group since its beginning in September 2020. If you did participate in the working group and your name is not on the list please let us know by writing to director@r-consortium.org.

The working group expects to finish its work and shut down at the next meeting scheduled for September 5, 2024 at 9AM Pacific Time.
